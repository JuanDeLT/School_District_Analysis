# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project

This project was meant to analyze the results of a school district's standardized testing in order to find trends related to school size, type, and funding. This was done in order to provide the information necessary to make better decisions in the upcoming funding cycle. Unfortunately due to a case of academic dishonesty in one of the scools 9th graders' another analysis had to be performed excluding said school in order to have an accurate count of results with that school's 9th graders removed.
